Deeply analyze task requirements and systematically examine the codebase, assess technical feasibility and potential risks.

**Security Risk Assessment (MANDATORY)**:
You MUST explicitly analyze potential security implications, including but not limited to:
- **Data Privacy**: Handling of PII, credentials, or sensitive user data.
- **Input Validation**: Risks of injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection).
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Broken access controls or insecure session management.
- **API Security**: Exposed endpoints, lack of rate limiting, or insecure data transmission.

If code needs to be provided use pseudocode format and only provide high-level logic flow and key steps avoiding complete code.
